Sounds like an exciting project! Creating a tool where users can practice **League of Legends combos** without actually starting the game will require building an interactive web application with real-time input handling, animations, and smooth performance. I'll guide you on the full-stack choices you should consider, especially with your experience and the project goals.

### Project Overview:
- **Front-End**: The front-end will need to handle input (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses) and display the corresponding animations for champion abilities and combos.
- **Back-End**: The back-end could serve data like champion stats, ability information, combo logic, and possibly user authentication if you want users to save progress or preferences.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: You will need some way to handle real-time interactions, potentially with WebSockets for fast communication between the client and server.

### Recommended Full Stack Setup

#### 1. **Front-End**
Since your project involves complex UI interactions and possibly game-like mechanics, I recommend the following technologies:

- **Language**: **JavaScript/TypeScript**
    - **Reasoning**: JavaScript (and TypeScript for type safety) is the de facto standard for web front-end development. Your animations, input handling, and DOM manipulation will be much easier to achieve with it.
  
- **Framework**: **React** or **Vue.js**
    - **Reasoning**: These frameworks are excellent for building interactive UIs and handling complex state, making them a good fit for a project involving fast user inputs and animations.
    - **React** is more widely used, with a larger ecosystem and more learning resources. Vue.js has a simpler learning curve and might be more intuitive if you're new to front-end development.

- **Libraries for Animations**: 
    - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** or **Anime.js**
    - **Reasoning**: These libraries are powerful for animating complex game-like interactions, transitions, and visual effects.

- **Game-like Interaction Frameworks**:
    - **Phaser.js**: If you want more game-specific features (like physics, advanced input, or game loops), Phaser.js is a game framework built for 2D games on the web and might be a great choice for handling combos, cooldowns, and animations.

#### 2. **Back-End**
For a server that handles the logic of champion abilities, combos, and possibly user profiles:

- **Language**: **Python (Django)** or **Node.js (Express)** 
    - **Reasoning**:
        - **Python (Django)**: Given your experience with Python, Django would be an excellent choice for the back-end. Django is a high-level web framework that helps with rapid development and follows the "batteries included" philosophy, meaning it comes with a lot of built-in features like authentication, session management, and routing.
        - **Node.js (Express)**: Alternatively, Node.js with Express.js is a great choice if you want to stick to JavaScript across the stack. It's lightweight, asynchronous, and well-suited for real-time applications with WebSockets.
  
- **Database**: 
    - **PostgreSQL**: For relational data like user progress or champion stats.
    - **MongoDB**: If your data is more flexible and document-based (e.g., ability combos or custom user settings).
    
#### 3. **Real-Time Communication**
To handle real-time interactions (such as registering key presses and responding instantly):

- **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**:
    - **Reasoning**: For real-time communication between the client and the server, **Socket.IO** is a good choice. It can help transmit combo sequences, handle cooldowns, and animate based on server-side responses.

#### 4. **DevOps & Hosting**
Once your app is built, youâ€™ll need to host it somewhere. For hosting and deployment:

- **Cloud Hosting**: 
    - **Heroku** (Easy for beginners) or **AWS** (More powerful and flexible)
    - **Vercel** (Optimized for front-end apps, especially with React)
  
- **CI/CD**: Use tools like **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** for automating testing and deployment.

#### Suggested Tech Stack:

1. **Front-End:**
   - Language: **TypeScript**
   - Framework: **React** (or Vue.js if preferred)
   - Libraries: **GSAP/Anime.js** for animations, **Phaser.js** for game-like interactions

2. **Back-End:**
   - Language: **Node.js (Express.js)** or **Python (Django)**
   - Database: **PostgreSQL** (or MongoDB depending on data needs)
   - Real-Time: **Socket.IO** for handling real-time interactions

3. **DevOps:**
   - Hosting: **Vercel (Front-End)**, **Heroku or AWS (Back-End)**
   - CI/CD: **GitHub Actions**

### Next Steps for Learning & Building:
1. **Learn Front-End Frameworks (React/Vue)**:
   - Start with learning React or Vue and building small interactive projects. This will help you get used to state management, component design, and handling user inputs.

2. **Learn Back-End Basics**:
   - If you go with **Node.js (Express)**, build a simple API with CRUD operations, and then add WebSocket support. If you go with **Django**, build a small app with user authentication and form handling.

3. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - Integrate **Socket.IO** into your project to practice real-time interaction.

4. **Animation and Interaction**:
   - Experiment with **GSAP** or **Phaser.js** to add visual effects and interactive elements to your front-end.
